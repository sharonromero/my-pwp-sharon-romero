My personal website project that will showcase my web projects.

## Milestone1
Great job on Milestone1. The scope of work you outlined in your Purpose, Audience, and Goal matches the guidelines in the project specifications. The persona also clearly identifies the target demographic for your PWP. Finally, your HTML is error free and is structured in a clear, coherent manner.
  ### Edits and Suggestions
 I love the focus of your PWP. Learning to code is an intimidating endeavor, and I can see how having a site that highlights the type of work a junior developer can accomplish would be of great value to someone just starting to code. I am a little curious if you plan to show this site to potential employers. If you do plan on also targeting employers I want you to consider how serving both demographics may affect the design of your PWP.
 * You skipped the goal section in your persona. The goal section defines what your target demographic gains by using your site. By not including a goal It is hard to determine what value your site gives your end users.
  *  Side note: the git@githitub.com URLs are used for doing git commands from the command line but don't do much outside of that. You can click on "Use HTTPS" from the "Clone or download" tab to see the standard web URL for linking to GitHub projects!
  ### Grade Tier III

## Milestone 2a Feedback
Good job on your Milestone 2a. The details about the different sections of your site could be more fleshed out, but you indicated the main points you want to have on your personal site and sometimes it makes sense to have a simple, straight-forward sections. You also connected this site to your persona, which is great. Nice job!

Your Milestone 2a passes at a Tier III.
